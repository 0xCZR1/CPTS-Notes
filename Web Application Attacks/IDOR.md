Insecure Direct Object Reference refers to a technique that abuses the lack of access control on the back-end side. Reaching a solid access control on the back-end is an ideology due to the fact it would disrupt the availability of the web app too much, so the web app relies on front-end maneuvers to sanitize the direct object reference field.
It could be encoded and than hashed, but it also matters when, if it does this prior to reaching an API endpoint or any sub-level we can try and detect it via the source code. If it does this right we can try and compare the DOR value and maybe predict it.
