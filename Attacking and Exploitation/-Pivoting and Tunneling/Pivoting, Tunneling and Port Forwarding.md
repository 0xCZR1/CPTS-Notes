Pivoting is different than lateral movement as pivoting will refer to pivot to a segmented network, on a different NIC through a compromised host.

There are 4 main types of port forwarding: local, remote, dynamic and reverse and they can be achieved through numerous tools.

Each of these techniques serves different purposes depending on the network topology and security restrictions you're dealing with. For instance:

- Local forwarding is great when you need to access specific internal services
- Remote forwarding helps when you need to expose local services to remote machines
- Dynamic forwarding is ideal when you need flexible access to multiple services
- Reverse tunneling is essential when direct connections to the target are blocked


Scanning the other NIC with Powershell: 
```powershell
 1..254 | ForEach-Object { $num = $_; Test-Connection "172.16.5.$num" -Count 1 -Quiet | Where-Object {$_} | ForEach-Object { Write-Host "172.16.5.$num is up" }}
```
