#### ðŸ“š Definition:
*Correlating and connecting the dots from the information and vulnerabilities found in the recon phase to accomplish taking over the target by successfully executing payloads.*

#### ðŸ“š Cyber Kill Chain's Definition for Exploitation:
*The "Exploitation" stage of the Cyber Kill Chain involves taking advantage of vulnerabilities identified during reconnaissance to execute the malicious payload delivered in the previous stage. This can include exploiting software vulnerabilities, weak configurations, or human errors to gain control over the target system.*

This stage begins from the initial plan of the exploit, what PoC we will use, do we have to tailor the PoC. Do we even have a PoC? 

Once we have it we must make sure the PoC will not cause disruptions within the system/service we are using it against.

Once we got the foothold we must make sure we go under the radar or depending on the assessment type make noise.

There are 3 types of attack evasiveness:
1. Non-Evasive
2. Evasive 
3. Hybrid-Evasive

Sometimes we might be asked to go Hybrid-Evasive, to test the performance of the EDRs in place, etc...

#### Information Gathering:
Once we are on a system, we can think of it like we are starting again, meaning we will do the information gathering process and vulnerability assessment process all over again because we are now performing those from a local perspective which is less restricted and will give us more information to work with.

#### Pillaging:
In this stage we will check the services, routes, configurations, users of a system to understand what is it's role within the network.

#### Persistence:
In this stage we will establish persistence on the target host.

#### Vulnerability Assessment:
Once we have persistence in place we can start to assess what we found.

#### Privilege Escalation:
Based on our findings we will try to escalate our privileges to a higher role.

#### Data Exfilration:
Here we will try to exfiltrate data and bypass EDRs. Here a lot of communication with the client has to be done and compliance must be respected!
