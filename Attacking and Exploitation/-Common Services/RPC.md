# Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in Operating System
Is a great feature for constructing distributed client-server based applications. In the general **LOCAL PROCEDURE CALL** the so called procedure was expected to live in the same address space as the calling procedure, that's where RPC came in and extended this limitation, so that the so called procedure was not expected anymore to be in the same space.

It makes it possible so that a program from one device/computer can use the code from another computer, as if it were on the same computer.
