After we know that a certain host is up, we are interested in more information such as: 
- Open ports and its services
- Version of the services
- OS

There are 6 types of responses we can get when probing ports with NMAP:

| **State**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `open`             | This indicates that the connection to the scanned port has been established. These connections can be **TCP connections**, **UDP datagrams** as well as **SCTP associations**.                          |
| `closed`           | When the port is shown as closed, the TCP protocol indicates that the packet we received back contains an `RST` flag. This scanning method can also be used to determine if our target is alive or not. |
| `filtered`         | Nmap cannot correctly identify whether the scanned port is open or closed because either no response is returned from the target for the port or we get an error code from the target.                  |
| `unfiltered`       | This state of a port only occurs during the **TCP-ACK** scan and means that the port is accessible, but it cannot be determined whether it is open or closed.                                           |
| `open\|filtered`   | If we do not get a response for a specific port, `Nmap` will set it to that state. This indicates that a firewall or packet filter may protect the port.                                                |
| `closed\|filtered` | This state only occurs in the **IP ID idle** scans and indicates that it was impossible to determine if the scanned port is closed or filtered by a firewall.                                           |

There are a few scan types such as:

| Scan Type | Description                                                                                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -sS       | SYN Scan, this will send only one SYN Flagged Packet and will not complete the whole 3-way TCP handshake. *Requires SUDO* |
| -sT       | This handshake will complete the full 3-way TCP handshake.                                                                |
| -sU       | UDP Scan.                                                                                                                 |
| -sV       | Service Scan.                                                                                                             |
| -sA       | ACK Scan, this will send only one ACK Flagged Packet.                                                                     |

We can combine these scans with different parameters:


| Parameter          | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --disable-arp-ping | This will disable the default arp ping.                                                            |
| -n                 | This will disable DNS resolution.                                                                  |
| --packet-trace     | This will show all the packets sent and received.                                                  |
| --reason           | This will show a reason.                                                                           |
| -Pn                | This will disable host discovery (ICMP Echo Requests).                                             |
| -p-                | This will scan all ports.                                                                          |
| --stats-every=5s   | Checks the status of the scan every 5s and shows it.                                               |
| -v                 | Increases the verbosity.                                                                           |
| -A                 | Performs service detection, OS detection, traceroute and uses defaults scripts to scan the target. |

E.G.:

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -p 445 --reason  -sV
